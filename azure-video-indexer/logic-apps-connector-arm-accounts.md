# Use with a Logic Apps connector

[!INCLUDE [AMS VI retirement announcement](./includes/important-ams-retirement-abbreviated.md)]

Azure AI Video Indexer (VI) [REST API](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Upload-Video) supports both server-to-server and client-to-server communication. The API enables you to integrate video and audio insights into your application logic.

We support [Logic Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/logic-apps/) and [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/connectors/shared_videoindexer-v2/video-indexer-v2/) connectors that are compatible with the Azure AI Video Indexer API. 

You can use the connectors to set up custom workflows to effectively index and extract insights from a large amount of video and audio files, without writing a single line of code. Using the connectors for the integration gives you visibility on the health of your workflow and a way to debug it.

## Introduction

The example in this article creates Logic App flows. The Logic App and Power Automate capabilities and their editors are almost identical.

The two flow approach, two flows that work together, supports async upload and indexing of larger files effectively.

* The first flow is triggered when a blob is added or modified in an Azure Storage account. It uploads the new file to Azure AI Video Indexer with a callback URL to send a notification once the indexing operation completes.
* The second flow is triggered based on the callback URL and saves the extracted insights back to a JSON file in Azure Storage. 

The logic apps you create in this article contain one flow per app. The second section, **Create a new logic app of type consumption** explains how to connect the two. The second flow stands alone and is triggered by the first one.

When a file is uploaded and indexed from the first flow, it sends an HTTP request with the correct callback URL to trigger the second flow. Then, it will retrieve the insights generated by Azure AI Video Indexer. In this example, it will store the output of your indexing job in your Azure Storage. However, it's up to you what you do with the output.

## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](./includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]
- Create an ARM-based [Azure AI Video Indexer account](create-account-portal.md).
- Create an Azure Storage account. *Storage accounts for VI must be a Standard general-purpose v2 storage account*. Keep note of the access key for your Storage account.
    - Create two containers: one to store the media files, second to store the insights generated by Azure AI Video Indexer. In this article, the containers are `videos` and `insights`.

## Generate an access token

1. Generate an access token using the [generateAccessToken](/rest/api/videoindexer/stable/generate/access-token?tabs=HTTP#generate-accesstoken-for-account-contributor). Press **Try it** to get the correct values for your account. 
1. Copy and paste it to Notepad for a later step.

## Flow #1: Set up the file upload flow

This section describes how to set up the first, file upload, flow. The first flow is triggered when a blob is added or modified in an Azure Storage account. It uploads the new file to Azure AI Video Indexer with a callback URL to send a notification once the indexing operation completes. 

The flow steps are:

1. When a blob is added or modified (properties only) (V2)
1. Create SAS URI by path (V2)
1. HTTP
1. Upload video and index

### Create the When a blog is added or modified (properties only)(V2) step

1. Create the  <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.LogicApp" target="_blank">Logic App</a> in the same region as the Azure Video Indexer account region (recommended but not required). 
1. Call the logic app `UploadIndexVideosApp`.

    1. Select **Consumption** for **Plan type**.

        |----|----|
        |Location| Location of the associated the Azure AI Video Indexer account.|	
        | Account ID| Account ID of the associated Azure AI Video Indexer account. You can find the **Account ID** in the **Overview** page of your account, in the Azure portal. Or, the **Account settings** tab, left of the [Azure AI Video Indexer website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/).|
        |Access Token| Use the `body('HTTP')['accessToken']` expression to extract the access token in the right format from the previous HTTP call.|
        | Video Name| Select **List of Files Name** from the dynamic content of **When a blob is added or modified** action. |
        |Video URL|Select **Web Url** from the dynamic content of **Create SAS URI by path** action.|
        | Body| Can be left as default.|

    1. Select **Save**.

## Flow #2: Create a new logic app of type consumption

Create the second flow, Logic Apps of type consumption. The second flow is triggered based on the callback URL and saves the extracted insights back to a JSON file in Azure Storage. 

The flow steps are:

1. When a HTTP request is received
1. HTTP
1. Get Video Index
1. Create blob (V2)

### Set up the trigger
    
1. Search for and select the **When an HTTP request is received**.
    
    For the trigger, there is a HTTP POST URL field. The URL won’t be generated until after you save your flow; however, you'll need the URL eventually.

    > [!TIP]
    > We will come back to the URL created in this step. 

### Generate an access token

You might need to generate another access token depending on how you set up the first one. Copy and paste it into Notepad.

1. **Generate an access token**.
1. Select **Save** -> **+ New step**.

### Set up Get Video Indexer insights

1. Search for "Video Indexer".
1. From **Video Indexer(V2)**, select the **Get Video Index** action.
    
    Set the connection name:
    
    |Key| Value|
    |----|----|
    |Connection name| <*A name for connection*>. For example, `aviconnection`.|
    | API key| This is your personal API key, which is available under **Profile** at the [developer portal](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/profile). For more information, see [Subscribe to the API](video-indexer-use-apis.md#subscribe-to-the-api).|
    
    1. Select **Create**.

    1. Fill out the required parameters according to the table: 

        |Key| Value|
        |----|----|
        |Location|  The Location of the Azure AI Video Indexer account.|
        | Account ID| The Video Indexer account ID can be copied from the resource/account **Overview** page in the Azure portal.|
        | Video ID\*| For Video ID, add dynamic content of type **Expression** and put in the following expression: **triggerOutputs()['queries']['id']**. |
        | Access Token| From the dynamic content, under the **Parse JSON** section select the **accessToken** that is the output of the parse JSON action. |

        \*This expression tells the connecter to get the Video ID from the output of your trigger. In this case, the output of your trigger will be the output of **Upload video and index** in your first trigger.

    1. Select **Save** -> **+ New step**.


### Create a blob and store the insights JSON.

1. Search for "Azure blob", from the group of actions.
1. Select **Create blob(V2)**.
1. Set the connection to the blob storage that will store the JSON insights files.
    
    |Key| Value|
    |----|----|
    | Connection name| <*Enter a connection name*>.|
    | Authentication type |Access Key|
    | Azure Storage Account name| <* The storage account name where insights will be stored*>. |
    | Azure Storage Account Access key| Go to Azure portal-> my-storage-> under **Security + networking** ->Access keys -> copy one of the keys. |  
    
    1. Select **Create**.
    1. Set the folder in which insights will be stored.
        
    |Key| Value|
    |----|----|
    |Storage account name| <*Enter the storage account name that would contain the JSON output (in this tutorial is the same as the source video).>*|
    | Folder path | From the dropdown, select the `/insights`|
    | Blob name| From the dynamic content, under the **Get Video Index** section select **Name** and add `_insights.json`, insights file name will be the video name + insights.json   |
    | Blob content| From the dynamic content, under the **Get Video Index** section, select the **Body**. |
    1. Select **Save flow**.

### Update the callback URL to get notified when an index job is finished.

Once the flow is saved, an HTTP POST URL is created in the trigger. 

1. Copy the URL from the trigger. 
1. Go back to the first flow and paste the URL in the **Upload video and index** action for the **Callback URL parameter**.
 
Make sure both flows are saved.
