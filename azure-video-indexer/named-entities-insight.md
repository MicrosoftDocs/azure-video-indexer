# Get named entities extraction insights

Named entities extraction uses natural language processing (NLP) to find locations, people, and brands in audio and images in media files. Named entities extraction uses transcription and optical character recognition (OCR).

## Named entities use cases

- Contextual advertising, for example, placing an ad for a pizza chain following footage on Italy.
- Deep searching media archives for insights on people or locations to create feature stories for the news.
- Creating a verbal description of footage using optical character recognition (OCR) processing to enhance accessibility for the visually impaired, for example a background storyteller in movies.
- Extracting insights on brand names.

## View the insight JSON with the web portal

After you upload and index a video, download insights in JSON format from the web portal.

1. Select the **Library** tab.
1. Select the media you want.
1. Select **Download**, and then select **Insights (JSON)**. The JSON file opens in a new browser tab.
1. Find the key pair described in the example response.
