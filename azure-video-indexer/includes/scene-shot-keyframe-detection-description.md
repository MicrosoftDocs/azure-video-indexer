Scene detection detects when a scene changes in a video based on visual cues. 

A **scene** depicts a single event and is composed of a series of shots, which are related.

**Shots** are a series of frames distinguished by visual cues such as abrupt and gradual transitions in color scheme of adjacent frames. The shot's metadata includes start and end time, and a list of keyframes included in the shot.

A **keyframe** is a frame from a shot that best represents a shot.
