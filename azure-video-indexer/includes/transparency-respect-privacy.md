## Respect privacy
When used responsibly and carefully Azure AI Video Indexer is a valuable tool for many industries. To respect the privacy and safety of others, we recommend the following:  

- Always respect an individual’s right to privacy, and only ingest videos for lawful and justifiable purposes.  
- Do not purposely disclose inappropriate media showing young children or family members of celebrities or other content that may be detrimental or pose a threat to an individual’s personal freedom.  
- Commit to respecting and promoting human rights in the design and deployment of your analyzed media.  
- When using 3rd party materials, be aware of any existing copyrights or required permissions before distributing content derived from them.
- Always seek legal advice when using media from unknown sources.
- Always obtain appropriate legal and professional advice to ensure that your uploaded videos are secured and have adequate controls to preserve the integrity of your content and to prevent unauthorized access.
- Provide a feedback channel that allows users and individuals to report issues with the service.  
- Be aware of any applicable laws or regulations that exist in your area regarding processing, analyzing, and sharing media containing people.
- Keep a human in the loop. Do not use any solution as a replacement for human oversight and decision-making.  
- Fully examine and review the potential of any AI model you are using to understand its capabilities and limitations.
