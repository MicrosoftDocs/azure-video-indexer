## Post-production: digital patterns

Digital patterns detection detects [color bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_color_bars) used during filming. Digital patterns is part of the post-production insights that you can select in the web portal [advanced settings](../indexing-configuration-guide.md?#advanced-settings) when you upload and index the file.

## Digital patterns use cases

Digital patterns detection is most commonly used for color correction during post-production editing of visual media.

### [Example responses](#tab/patternsresponse)

You can use digital patterns detection for detecting color bars and test cards.
