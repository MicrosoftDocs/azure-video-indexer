## Optical character recognition (OCR)

[!INCLUDE [ocr description](ocr-description.md)]

OCR extracts insights from printed and handwritten text in over 50 languages, including from an image with text in multiple languages. For more information, see [OCR supported languages](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/language-support#optical-character-recognition-ocr).

For more information about OCR, seeâ€¯[OCR technology](/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview-ocr).

## OCR use cases

- Deep searching media footage for images with signposts, street names, or car license plates, for example, in law enforcement. 
- Extracting text from images in media files and then translating it into multiple languages in labels for accessibility, for example in media or entertainment. 
- Detecting brand names in images and tagging them for translation purposes, for example in advertising and branding. 
- Extracting text in images that is then automatically tagged and categorized for accessibility and future usage, for example to generate content at a news agency. 
- Extracting text in warnings in online instructions and then translating the text to comply with local standards, for example, e-learning instructions for using equipment.
