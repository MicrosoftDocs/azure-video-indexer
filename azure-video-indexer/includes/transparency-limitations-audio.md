### Audio
- Avoid use of audio with very loud background music or music with repetitive and/or linearly scanned frequency, audio effects detection is designed for non-speech audio only and therefore cannot classify events in loud music. Music with repetitive and/or linearly scanned frequency many be incorrectly classified as an alarm or siren.
