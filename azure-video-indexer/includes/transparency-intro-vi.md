## Introduction to Azure AI Video Indexer

Azure AI Video Indexer (VI) is a cloud-based tool that processes and analyzes uploaded video and audio files to generate different types of insights. These insights include detected objects, people, faces, key frames and translations or transcriptions in at least 60 languages. The insights and their time frames are displayed in a categorized list on the Azure AI Video Indexer website where each insight can be seen by pressing its Play button.

While processing the files, the Azure AI Video Indexer employs a portfolio of Microsoft AI algorithms to analyze, categorize, and index the video footage. The resulting insights are then archived and can be comprehensively accessed, shared, and reused. For example, a news media outlet may implement a deep search for insights related to the Empire State Building and then reuse their findings in different movies, trailers, or promos.  

## The basics of Azure AI Video Indexer

Azure AI Video Indexer is a cloud-based Azure AI services product that is integrated with Azure AI services. It allows you to upload video and audio files, process the video (including running AI models on them) and then save the processed files and resulting data to a cloud-based Azure Media Services account.

To process the media files, Azure AI Video Indexer employs AI technologies like Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and hierarchical ontology models with voice tonality analysis to extract insights like brands, keywords, topics, and text-based emotion detection.

Azure AI Video Indexer’s capabilities include searching for insights in archives, promoting content accessibility, content moderation and content editing.

Insights categories include:

| Insight category | Description |
|--|--|
| Audio media | For example, transcriptions, translations, audio event detection like clapping and crowd laughter, gun shots and explosions |
| Video media | For example, faces, clothing detection |
| Video with audio media | For example, named entities in transcripts, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), for example, names of locations, people, or brands |
