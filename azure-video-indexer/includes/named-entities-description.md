Named entities extraction uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract insights on the locations, people and brands appearing in audio and images in media files. Named entities extraction is automatically used with Transcription and OCR and its insights are based on those extracted during these processes. 

In the web portal, the resulting insights are displayed in the **Insights** tab and are filtered into locations, people and brand categories. Clicking a named entity, displays its instance in the media file. It also displays a description of the entity and a Find on Bing link of recognizable entities.
