> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Even after you update your account, VI still accesses your AMS account and its associated storage account until all your videos are migrated. Until the migration is complete, it's important that you DO NOT delete or change the accounts, roles, or permissions of the AMS, Azure Storage or VI accounts. In addition, we recommend that you don't delete any VI AMS assets until you get notified that the migration is complete because migration might be incomplete.
> 
> When completed, the VI account owner receives an email notification that migration is complete. You can also check the migration status on the VI website.
