> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Even after you have updated your account, VI will still access your AMS account and its associated storage account until all your videos have been migrated. Until the migration is complete, it's important that you DO NOT delete or change the accounts, roles, or permissions of the AMS, Azure Storage or VI accounts. In addition, it's recommended that VI AMS assets are not deleted until you are notified that the migration is complete as they might not have migrated yet. The VI account owner will receive an email notification that the migration is complete and you can check the migration status on the VI website as well.
