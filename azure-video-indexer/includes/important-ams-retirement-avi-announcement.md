> [!WARNING]
> Over the past year, Azure AI Video indexer announced the removal of its dependency on Azure Media Services due to its [retirement](https://aka.ms/ams-retirement). [Features adjustments](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/videoindexer-2/) and [changes](/azure/azure-video-indexer/azure-video-indexer-azure-media-services-retirement-announcement) were announced and a [migration guide](../azure-video-indexer-ams-retirement-guide.md) was provided.<br/><br/>
> The deadline to complete your migration was June 30, 2024. VI has extended the update/migrate deadline so you can update your VI account and opt in to the AMS VI asset migration through August 31.<br/><br/>
> However, after June 30th, if you have **not** updated your VI account, you **won't be able to index new videos nor will you be able to play any videos** that have not been migrated.If you update your account after June 30, you can resume indexing immediately but will be unable to play videos indexed before the account update until they are migrated through the AMS VI migration.
