Labels identification is an Azure AI Video Indexer AI feature that identifies visual objects like sunglasses or actions like swimming, appearing in the video footage of a media file. There are many labels identification categories and once extracted, labels identification instances are displayed in the Insights tab and can be translated into over 50 languages. Clicking a Label opens the instance in the media file, select Play Previous or Play Next to see more instances.
