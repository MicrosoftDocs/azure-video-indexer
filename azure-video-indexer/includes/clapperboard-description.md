[Clapper board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapperboard) detection detects clapper boards used during filming that also provides the information detected on the clapper board as metadata, for example, *production*, *roll*, *scene*, *take*, etc. Clapper board is part of the post-production insights that you can select in the web portal [advanced settings](../indexing-configuration-guide.md?#advanced-settings) when you upload and index the file.
