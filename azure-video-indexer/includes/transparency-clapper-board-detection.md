title: transparency clapper board detection
---

## Transparency notes

- The values might not be correctly identified by the detection algorithm.
- The titles of the fields appearing on the clapper board are optimized to identify the most popular fields appearing on top of clapper boards.  
- Handwritten text or digital digits might not be correctly identified by the fields detection algorithm.
- The algorithm is optimized to identify fields' categories that appear horizontally.  
- The clapper board might not be detected if the frame is blurred or that the text written on it can't be read by the human eye.  
- Empty fieldsâ€™ values might lead to wrong fields categories.
