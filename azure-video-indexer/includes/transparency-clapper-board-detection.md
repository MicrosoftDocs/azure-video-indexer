## Clapper board detection notes

- The detection algorithm might not correctly identify the values.
- The titles of the fields appearing on the clapper board are optimized to identify the most popular fields appearing on top of clapper boards.  
- The fields detection algorithm might not correctly identify handwritten text or digital digits.
- The algorithm is optimized to identify fields' categories that appear horizontally.  
- The clapper board might not be detected if the frame is blurred or the text written on it can't be read by the human eye.
