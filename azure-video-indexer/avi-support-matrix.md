# Azure AI Video Indexer support matrix and service limits

[!INCLUDE [AMS VI retirement announcement](./includes/important-ams-retirement-abbreviated.md)]

This article describes the supported formats and limitations of Azure AI Video Indexer.

## Upload file size and video duration 

### File size limits

If uploading a file from your device, the file size limit is 2 GB.

If the video is uploaded from a URL, the file size limit is 30 GB. The URL must lead to an online media file with a media file extension (for example `myvideo.MP4`) and not a webpage such as `https://www.youtube.com`.

### File duration limit

The file duration limit is 6 hours for all presets with the exclusion of the Basic Audio preset which has a file duration limit of 12 hours.

## Index request limit

When uploading and indexing through the VI website, up to 10 videos can be indexed in a single request. When submitting requests through the API, there's an API request limit of 10 requests per second and up to 120 requests per minute.

## Languages

See our [Language support article](language-support.md) for the list of languages supported.

When using single or multi language detection, there's a limit of 10 languages allowed for identification during the indexing of a media file. You can select the 10 languages.

## OCR

Video Indexer has an OCR limit of 50,000 words per indexed video. Once the limit has been reached, no additional OCR results are generated.
