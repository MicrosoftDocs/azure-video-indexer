# Azure AI Video Indexer account types overview

Azure AI Video Indexer provides different types of accounts to suit various user needs, including trial accounts for testing and paid accounts for production use.

## Trial account

Try a free trial Azure AI Video Indexer account with your content. You don't need an Azure subscription. The account provides up to 2,400 minutes of free indexing using the [Azure AI Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website or the Azure AI Video Indexer API (see the [developer portal](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/)).

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't use your trial account for 12 months, it can be deleted. To keep your account, sign in at least once every 12 months.

## Azure AI Video Indexer account

Azure AI Video Indexer paid accounts are Azure Resource Manager (ARM) based and unlike trial accounts, are created with your Azure subscription. ARM-based accounts give you access to security and management capabilities, such as [Role Based Access Control (RBAC) user management](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview), [Azure Monitor integration](/azure/azure-monitor/overview), deployment through ARM templates, and more.

A paid account that doesn't have minute, support, or service level agreement (SLA) limitations. Accounts can be created with the Azure portal. <!--(see [Create an account with the Azure portal](create-account-portal.md)) or API (see [Create accounts with API](/rest/api/videoindexer/stable/accounts)).-->
