# Get digital patterns with color bars insights

This article describes how to get insights for view digital patterns with color bars in Azure AI Video Indexer. Digital patterns detection is a post-production insight that identifies color bars used during filming, which can be useful for color correction and other post-production tasks.

## Post-production: digital patterns

Digital patterns detection finds [color bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_color_bars) used during filming. Digital patterns are part of post-production insights that you select in the web portal using **Slate detection** in [advanced settings](indexing-configuration-guide.md?#advanced-settings) when you upload and index the file.

## Digital patterns use cases

Digital patterns detection is most commonly used for color correction during post-production editing of visual media.

## View the insight JSON with the web portal

After you upload and index a video, download insights in JSON format from the web portal.

1. Select the **Library** tab.
1. Select the media you want.
1. Select **Download**, and then select **Insights (JSON)**. The JSON file opens in a new browser tab.
1. Find the key pair described in the example response.

## Use the API

1. Use a [Get Video Index](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Video-Index) request. Pass `&includeSummarizedInsights=false`.
2. Find the key pairs described in the example response.

## Example responses

You can use digital patterns detection for detecting color bars and test cards.

## Transparency notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read the [transparency note overview](/legal/azure-video-indexer/transparency-note?context=/azure/azure-video-indexer/context/context) for all VI features. Each insight also has its own transparency note.

- There can be a mismatch if the input video is of low quality (for example â€“ old Analog recordings). 
- The digital patterns are identified over the 10 min of the beginning and 10 min of the ending part of the video.

## Sample code
