      - question: What is the difference between private and public videos?
        answer: |
          When videos are uploaded to Azure AI Video Indexer, you can choose from two privacy settings: private and public. Public videos are accessible for anyone, including anonymous and unidentified users. Private ones are restricted solely to the account members.

      - question: I tried to upload a video as public and it was flagged for inappropriate or offensive content, what does that mean?
        answer: |
          When you upload a video to Azure AI Video Indexer, an automatic content analysis is done by algorithms and models in order to make sure no inappropriate content is publicly presented. If a video is found to be suspicious as containing explicit content, you can't set it as public. However, the account members can still access it as a private video (view it, download the insights and extracted artifacts, and perform other operations available to account members).

          > [!WARNING]
          > Don't use data directly from the artifacts folder for production purposes. Artifacts are intermediate outputs of the indexing process and are raw outputs of different AI engines that analyze videos. The artifacts schema might change over time.

          <!-- The warning text is duplicated in includes\scene-shot-keyframe-detection. Sync any changes  -->

          In order to set the video for public access, you can either:

          * Build your own interface layer (such as app or website) and use it to interact with the Azure AI Video Indexer service. This way the video remains private in our [website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) and your users can interact with it through your interface. For example, you can still get the insights or allow viewing of the video in your own interface.
          * Request a human review of the content, which would result in removing of the restriction assuming the content isn't explicit.

              This option can be explored if the Azure AI Video Indexer website is used directly by your users as the interface layer, and for public (unauthenticated) viewing.

      - question: What is the difference between Account access token, User access token, and Video access token?
        answer: |
          * Account level â€“ account level access tokens let you perform operations on the account level or the video level. For example, upload a video, list all videos, get video insights.
          * User level - user level access tokens let you perform operations on the user level. For example, get associated accounts.
          * Video level â€“ video level access tokens let you perform operations on a specific video. For example, get video insights, download captions, get widgets, etc.

      - question: How often do I need to get a new access token? When do access tokens expire?
        answer: |
          Access tokens expire every hour, so you need to generate a new access token every hour.
