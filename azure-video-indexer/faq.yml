Your video or audio content that has its privacy setting set to private is accessible only by users that were invited to the account of the video or audio content. The privacy setting of your content also applies to the metadata and insights that Azure AI Video Indexer extracts. You assign the privacy setting when you upload your video or audio file. You can also change the privacy setting after indexing.

      - question: What access does Microsoft have to my video or audio files?
        answer: |
          Per the [Azure Online Services Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31) (OST), you completely own your content. Microsoft only accesses your content and the metadata and insights that Azure AI Video Indexer extracts from your content according to the OST and the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

      - question: Are the custom models that I build in my Azure AI Video Indexer account available to other accounts?
        answer: |
           No, the custom models that you create in your account aren't available to any other account. Azure AI Video Indexer currently allows you to build custom [brands](customize-brands-model-overview.md), [language](customize-language-model-overview.md), and [person](customize-person-model-overview.md) models in your account. These models are only available in the account in which you created the models.

      - question: Is the content indexed by Video Indexer kept within the Azure region where I'm using Video Indexer?
        answer: |
          The source media file and encoded file are stored in the storage account that you linked to your Video Indexer account. You configure and manage the storage account. The insights generated by Azure AI Video Indexer are stored in a Video Indexer managed Azure Storage account in the same region as your Video Indexer account and is encrypted at rest using Microsoft-managed keys. The data is replicated using [geo-redundant storage](/azure/reliability/regions-paired#paired-regions) (GRS) to a paired Azure region.

      - question: What is the privacy policy for Azure AI Video Indexer?
        answer: |
          Azure AI Video Indexer is covered by the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement). The privacy statement explains the personal data Microsoft processes, how Microsoft processes it, and for what purposes Microsoft processes it. To learn more about privacy, visit the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center).

      - question: What certifications does Azure AI Video Indexer have?
        answer: |
          Azure AI Video Indexer currently has the SOC certification. To review Azure AI Video Indexer's certification, see [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/complianceofferings?product=Azure).

      - question: What is the difference between private and public videos?
        answer: |
          When videos are uploaded to Azure AI Video Indexer, you can choose from two privacy settings: private and public. Public videos are accessible for anyone, including anonymous and unidentified users. Private ones are restricted solely to the account members.

      - question: I tried to upload a video as public and it was flagged for inappropriate or offensive content, what does that mean?
        answer: |
          When you upload a video to Azure AI Video Indexer, an automatic content analysis is done by algorithms and models in order to make sure no inappropriate content is publicly presented. If a video is found to be suspicious as containing explicit content, you can't set it as public. However, the account members can still access it as a private video (view it, download the insights and extracted artifacts, and perform other operations available to account members).

          > [!WARNING]
          > Don't use data directly from the artifacts folder for production purposes. Artifacts are intermediate outputs of the indexing process and are raw outputs of different AI engines that analyze videos. The artifacts schema might change over time.

          <!-- The warning text is duplicated in includes\scene-shot-keyframe-detection. Sync any changes  -->

          In order to set the video for public access, you can either:

          * Build your own interface layer (such as app or website) and use it to interact with the Azure AI Video Indexer service. This way the video remains private in our [website](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) and your users can interact with it through your interface. For example, you can still get the insights or allow viewing of the video in your own interface.
          * Request a human review of the content, which would result in removing of the restriction assuming the content isn't explicit.

              This option can be explored if the Azure AI Video Indexer website is used directly by your users as the interface layer, and for public (unauthenticated) viewing.

          Follow [Tutorial: get started with the Azure AI Video Indexer API](video-indexer-use-apis.md).

      - question: What is an API access token and why do I need it?
        answer: |
          The Azure AI Video Indexer API contains an Authorization API and an Operations API. The Authorizations API contains calls that give you access token. Each call to the Operations API should be associated with an access token, matching the authorization scope of the call.

          Access tokens are needed to use the Azure AI Video Indexer APIs for security purposes. They ensure that any calls are coming from you or people that have access permissions to your account. 

      - question: What is the difference between Account access token, User access token, and Video access token?
        answer: |
          * Account level – account level access tokens let you perform operations on the account level or the video level. For example, upload a video, list all videos, get video insights.
          * User level - user level access tokens let you perform operations on the user level. For example, get associated accounts.
          * Video level – video level access tokens let you perform operations on a specific video. For example, get video insights, download captions, get widgets, etc.

      - question: How often do I need to get a new access token? When do access tokens expire?
        answer: |
          Access tokens expire every hour, so you need to generate a new access token every hour.

      - question: What sign in options are available for the Azure AI Video Indexer Developer portal?
        answer: |
          See a release note regarding [sign in information](release-notes.md#october-2020).
