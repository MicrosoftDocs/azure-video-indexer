# Create an Azure AI Video Indexer (VI) account

> [!NOTE]
> Face identification, customization, and celebrity recognition features access is limited based on eligibility and usage criteria in order to support our Responsible AI principles.

To start using Azure AI Video Indexer, create an Azure AI Video Indexer account.

This article walks you through the steps of creating the Azure AI Video Indexer account and its accompanying resources. The account that gets created is an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) account. For more information about different account types, see [Overview of account types](accounts-overview.md).

## Trial account

Try a free trial Azure AI Video Indexer account with your content. You don't need an Azure subscription. The account provides up to 2,400 minutes of free indexing using the [Azure AI Video Indexer](https://www.videoindexer.ai/) website or the Azure AI Video Indexer API (see the [developer portal](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/)).

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't use your trial account for 12 months, it can be deleted. To keep your account, sign in at least once every 12 months.

The trial account option isn't available for the Azure Government cloud. For other Azure Government limitations, see [Limitations of Azure AI Video Indexer on Azure Government](connect-to-azure.md#limitations-of-azure-ai-video-indexer-on-azure-government).

## Create an account

To create an Azure AI Video Indexer account, you can use the Azure portal or the API. The following sections describe how to create an account using each method.
