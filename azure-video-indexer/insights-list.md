## Some other insight

Audio effects detection detects insights on acoustic events and classifies them into categories such as laughter, crowd reactions, alarms and/or sirens.

### [Use cases](#tab/otherusecases)

- bullted list goes here

**Audio effects detection** is one of Azure AI Video Indexer AI capabilities that detects various acoustics events and classifies them into different acoustic categories (such as dog barking, crowd reactions, laugher and more).

Some scenarios where this feature is useful:

- Companies with a large set of video archives can easily improve accessibility with audio effects detection. The feature provides more context for persons who are hard of hearing, and enhances video transcription with nonspeech effects.
- In the Media & Entertainment domain, the detection feature can improve efficiency when creating raw data for content creators. Important moments in promos and trailers (such as laughter, crowd reactions, gunshot, or explosion) can be identified by using **audio effects detection**.
- In the Public Safety & Justice domain, the feature can detect and classify gunshots, explosions, and glass shattering. It can be implemented in a smart-city system or in other public environments that include cameras and microphones to offer fast and accurate detection of violence incidents.
